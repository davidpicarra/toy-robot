## What was done

A component called `ToyRobot.vue` was created to allow a Robot to be place in a 5x5 grid. The following commands are available:

```javascript
help() // shows available commands
place(x, y, facing) // place the robot at x, y location and facing the direction provided
move() // moves the robot 1 unit forward in the direction it's facing
left() // rotate left 90 degrees anti-clockwise
right() // rotate right 90 degrees clockwise
report() // outputs current robots location and direction
clear() // clear the messages
```

## How to run the app

In order to run the app locally, the following commands must be executed:
```bash
# npm
$ npm install
$ npm run dev

# yarn
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

## Build setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
